With essential support from Denise Hayman and her sisters in the Mu Pi chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority, the class conducted 27 hours of interviews with 26 people, 9 men and 16 women. They include alumni of the university and longtime residents of Newark\u2019s African American community known as New London Road.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n<p>The recorded memories of the interviewees convey a mixed message about their experiences at the university and in Newark. Interviewees shared many stories of personal experiences with racism and discrimination, as well as narratives of power and achievement in the community and at the university.\u00a0 The audio recordings are accompanied by a detailed summary indexed by time code, allowing a quick review of an interview\u2019s contents and easy access to actual conversation.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n<p>The full set of interviews are available via a collection finding aid hosted by Special Collections at Morris Library:\u00a0<a href='\"https:\/\/library.udel.edu\/static\/purl.php?mss0989\"'>https:\/\/library.udel.edu\/static\/purl.php?mss0989&lt;\/a&gt;.

This was a critical time in UD\u2019s history: 1834 marks the formal founding of NewArk College, shortly renamed Delaware College, the chartered institution which later became the University of Delaware. In this period, slavery was a living institution in Delaware, and critical to the state\u2019s political and economic life. It was controversial, and complex: one of several systems of bondage actively practiced in the state, chattel slavery was part of a broader legal regime designed to control Black labor and constrain Black civil and political rights \u2013 and resisted as such. Students in the seminar used materials held by Special Collections in Morris Library, University Archives, government records, and contemporary newspapers to investigate how both the College community and Newark residents \u2013 white and Black, enslaved and free \u2013 engaged with Delaware\u2019s varied systems of bondage.\u00a0&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n<p><span 12pt;\"="" style='\"font-size:'>\r\n\r\n&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n<p><span 12pt;\"="" style='\"font-size:'>By recovering stories of Black life in antebellum Newark, as well as how Delaware College benefited from wealth generated from slavery and other forms of exploited Black labor, students in the course hoped to contribute to the UD community’s self-understanding.
