Inconsistent state support, economic depressions, and war meant that a given school could shut down at any time. Sometimes, wealth from slavery was all that kept an institution afloat. In recent years universities around the country have grappled with this aspect of their respective histories. Rutgers, for example, was bailed out not once, but twice, by the generosity of enslavers, while Georgetown avoided financial ruin in 1838 by selling 272 people enslaved by the school.<sup>[1&lt;\/sup&gt;<sup>]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0In the early 1850s, the University of Delaware\u2014or Delaware College, as it was then-known\u2014was likewise rescued by its ties to chattel slavery. Without the financial support of concerned enslavers, the institution as we know it today would not exist. The following blog entry explores this overlooked chapter in the school\u2019s history and adds the University of Delaware to ongoing conversations about institutions of higher education that owe their survival to slavery.&lt;\/p&gt;\n<p>There were calls to shutter Delaware College as early as 1843\u2014only ten years after its incorporation.<sup>[2] &lt;\/sup&gt;This early effort was led by a pair of former trustees who felt that their successors were mismanaging the school\u2019s funds.<sup>[3]&lt;\/sup&gt; \u00a0While unsuccessful, the men were not wrong about the poor financial state of the institution. Indeed, its dwindling endowment eventually led to an official motion to disband the college at a January 1850 meeting of the board of trustees. The school was saved, however, by a novel fundraising plan suggested by President Matthew Meigs: the selling of scholarships. For $100 (not an inconsequential sum in those days), a buyer could send twenty students to Delaware College tuition-free.<sup>[4]&lt;\/sup&gt; \u00a0Meigs and the trustees hoped that the scheme would raise up to $100,000 by the end of 1852 and replenish the school\u2019s endowment; if it failed to raise at least $50,000, the money would be returned, and Delaware College would likely close. This ambitious plan, variations of which were also tried at institutions like Wesleyan, Oberlin, and Columbia, effectively made the school dependent on wealthy benefactors\u2014including enslavers.<sup>[5]&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n<p>The Delaware College account book, currently in the University Archives at the University of Delaware, provides a partial list of scholarship buyers. Approximately one third of them were enslavers.<sup>[6] &lt;\/sup&gt;Among their ranks were doctors, lawyers, politicians, and businesspeople. The latter two groups were especially well represented. For example, Delaware\u2019s governor, William Henry Harrison Ross, and the state\u2019s sole member of the House of Representatives, George Read Riddle, both purchased scholarships. Ross enslaved over a dozen people on his Sussex County plantation, while Riddle held three people in bondage in his Wilmington mansion.<sup>[7]&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n<p>When it came to businesspeople, the most prominent were the Reybold brothers and Robert Polk. Anthony, William, and Philip Reybold Jr. were all sons and business partners of Major Philip Reybold, the \u201cPeach King of Delaware.\u201d Philip Sr. was one of the first farmers in the state to grow peaches on a commercial scale. By the mid-nineteenth century, he and his sons managed a network of orchards that dotted the length of the Chesapeake &amp; Delaware Canal.<sup>[8]&lt;\/sup&gt; Much of the work on these properties was done by enslaved people. In early 1856, for example, abolitionist William Still noted the arrival of three freedom seekers in Philadelphia. The men\u2014James Green, Jonathan Fisher, and John Henry\u2014had recently been enslaved on adjoining peach farms owned by William and Anthony Reybold.<sup>[9]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0Robert Polk, meanwhile, was William and Anthonys\u2019 brother-in-law. He was also one of the wealthiest men in Delaware, as described in a biography from 1899:&lt;\/p&gt;\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Polk\u2026owned and ran the steamboats (and held much of the stock) that drew all the commerce through the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal, having control of it, and was also interested in other branches of commerce. He was a very large land owner in Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Texas, and Florida. He owned many fruitful farms and plantations.”<sup>[10]&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;\/blockquote&gt;\n<p>Upon his death in 1854, Polk\u2019s probate inventory listed seven enslaved people: a man named Daniel, two women named Minda and Mary, and Mary\u2019s four children (none of whom were referred to by name).<sup>[11]&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n<p>On the surface, Meigs\u2019s scholarship plan seemed to work. In October 1852, the trustees announced that the fundraiser had brought in $50,000, the minimum amount required to keep Delaware College open. This claim, however, was misleading. According to historian John A. Munroe, the $50,000 figure included cash on hand <em>and &lt;\/em&gt;IOUs. Only around $25,000\u2014half of the target amount\u2014had actually been collected by the school. Unfortunately for the trustees, students, and faculty, this was only enough to keep the college running for a few years, especially when so many IOUs went unpaid. As enrollment increased (temporarily boosted by students attending on scholarships), the money steadily ran out.<sup>[12]&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n<p>In March 1859, once it became clear that the state would not intervene on behalf of Delaware College, its trustees fired the remaining faculty and suspended all classes. The institution was not disbanded, but rather went into a type of hibernation. Its remaining endowment was left intact, and the trustees continued to meet and discuss new options for fundraising\u2014the only things missing were courses, professors, and students. As early as 1858, there were hopes that a proposed land-grant bill in the U.S. Congress might rescue the school.<sup>[13]&lt;\/sup&gt; \u00a0Under this act, each state was granted a certain amount of federal land (taken from Indigenous nations) which they could then sell and use the proceeds to fund higher education.<sup>[14] &lt;\/sup&gt;When the bill finally passed in 1862, the trustees saw their chance. It took five years, but they eventually convinced the state legislature to designate Delaware College as the recipient of any land-grant funds. After a few more years of preparation, classes finally resumed in September 1870.<span 10pt;\"="" style='\"font-size:'><sup>[15]&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n<p>Delaware College would not have survived to that point without the money of enslavers. By January 1850, its endowment was so diminished that closing the institution seemed to make the most financial sense. The school only received a new lease on life thanks to President Meigs\u2019s scholarship plan, which placated the trustees and kept the college intact. An examination of who took part in this fundraising drive reveals that its success hinged on the support of enslavers like George Read Riddle and the Reybold brothers. Indeed, the University of Delaware\u2014as Delaware College was renamed in 1921\u2014exists today largely because of such individuals and the wealth produced by the people they enslaved.&lt;\/p&gt;\n<p><em>Ryan Bachman graduated from the University of Delaware with a Ph.D. in history in August 2023.
