Hughes | Posted: 7-7-2022&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Delaware College, the antebellum school that would later become the University of Delaware, was located at the intersection of North and South, and\u00a0sat at\u00a0the crossroads of national\u00a0discussions around slavery, race, and union. Records from\u00a0the 1850s\u00a0indicate that students at Delaware College discussed\u00a0slavery\u00a0among themselves in formal and informal venues.\u00a0And while College officials failed to make any statement of support in one direction or the other, the actions of trustees and faculty of the college\u00a0show that they were\u00a0powerful men who worked to preserve slavery \u2013 and minimize debate on the subject.\u00a0&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>One possible reason for\u00a0Delaware College\u2019s quiescent stance on slavery\u00a0was\u00a0the\u00a0financial peril in which the school found itself in the 1850s.<sup>[1]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0Attendance had dwindled over the course of the 1840s, and by 1851 the school faced insolvency.\u00a0Desperate for students and the revenue they would bring, the College was reluctant to make policy statements that could alienate potential applicants, especially those from Sussex County, where slavery remained entrenched, and points further south.<sup>[2]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0Delaware College was not alone in considering slavery in light of institutional finances; Princeton University actively sought to \u201cmake their southern students and slaveholding patrons feel welcome\u201d on campus in the years leading up to the Civil War.<sup>[3]&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Pro-slavery sentiment appears to have circulated within the student body at Delaware College.\u00a0One source on this subject is the nine-year\u00a0correspondence\u00a0between\u00a0Gideon Waples and John Lovell.<sup>[4]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0Both students came from strongholds of slavery\u2013Sussex County, Delaware and Front Royal, Virginia, respectively\u2013and from enslaving households.\u00a0In November 1856, days after the presidential election, Lovell wrote of his \u201cstump speeches\u201d on behalf of newly-elected James Buchanan,\u00a0a pro-slavery Democrat, before referencing a conversation with Waples years earlier: \u201cI am henceforth a\u00a0Democrat\u2026you were\u00a0right\u00a0when we were at Delaware College together, and I was\u00a0wrong\u2014now we\u00a0march\u00a0with the\u00a0only party\u00a0that keeps step to \u2018the music of the Union.\u201d<sup>[5]&lt;\/sup&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>While Lovell and others may have evoked the preservation of the union as their political lodestar, the subtext of this position was really about the preservation of slavery. As early as 1842, future President James Buchanan heralded the Democratic party not just as one that tolerated slavery but indeed was \u201chostile\u201d toward abolition.<sup>[6]&lt;\/sup&gt; Waples was pro-slavery throughout his time at Delaware College, and\u00a0Lovell\u2019s note shows that he\u00a0has moved more toward Waples\u2019s perspective. This letter fairly accurately summarizes Waples\u2019 thoughts from their college years and conversations the two had at that time, likely in the midst of other students.\u00a0That Lovell evokes conversations from five years earlier reveals the importance that he placed on conversations at school that shaped his own political ideology.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Among students,\u00a0slavery was not limited to one-on-one conversations. Records for the Delta Phi and Athenean Literary Societies indicate that speeches often drew from\u00a0national current events.\u00a0Subjects for weekly debates included \u201cWould the condition of the United States be improved by the formation of two republics\u2014the Northern and the Southern?\u201d and \u201cShould the Missouri Compromise be reversed?\u201d<sup>[7]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0Both\u00a0these questions relate to the national conversation over the spread of slavery and the related question over whether \u201ca house divided\u201d could still stand.<sup>[8]&lt;\/sup&gt; These records\u00a0also show frameworks for debating these political subjects: the\u00a0Delta Phi constitution dictated strict policies and procedures for debate, stipulating, for example, that speakers should not \u201cmake any remarks on political subjects or on any other subject which may have a tendency to wound the feelings of any member.\u201d<sup>[9]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0It is worth noting the casual privilege exerted by these men, some themselves enslavers, in turning discussions of slavery and race into opportunities\u00a0for grandiloquence,\u00a0rather than fundamentally reckoning with\u00a0slavery\u2019s inhumanity\u00a0or the implications of exploitative labor.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This is not to say that the campus conversation around slavery remained abstract. In December 1853, a freedom seeker (a fugitive from slavery), sought shelter on campus. Student Joseph Cleaver, Jr. described this event in his journal, noting that the college president and Presbyterian minister Reverend W.S.F. Graham refused this request for aid, explaining that \u201cthe College must not break the law even when the law seems wrong.\u201d<sup>[10]&lt;\/sup&gt; Cleaver\u2019s story provides a concrete example of the school\u2019s attitude toward slavery. By denying refuge to a fugitive from bondage, and instead upholding a law that was understood as immoral by antislavery activists, Rev. Graham would have taught the students a very specific lesson.\u00a0&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Trustees\u2019 actions\u00a0provided\u00a0additional\u00a0examples that students would have seen. In their positions of power, trustees stood to lead conversations surrounding slavery and race, both on campus as well as in the state. In early 1841, trustees John Adams, John Clark, and Whitley Graham signed a petition in requesting laws \u201crestraining the idle and roving habits\u201d of free Blacks,<sup>[11]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0<a href='\"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/2022\/06\/23\/free-black-petitioning-in-antebellum-delaware\/\"'>one petition out of many that were designed to preclude political agency of a growing free Black population&lt;\/a&gt;.<sup>[12]&lt;\/sup&gt; Trustees also quashed anti-slavery discussion in Newark. In an article from the <em>Pennsylvania Freeman&lt;\/em&gt; in February 1852, anti-slavery\u00a0speaker\u00a0C.M. Burleigh reported that <a href='\"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/2022\/06\/23\/enslavement-exploitation-and-upholding-unfreedom\/\"'>Rathmell Wilson&lt;\/a&gt;,\u00a0the President of the Delaware College Board of Trustees,\u00a0and\u00a0James L. Miles,\u00a0Secretary\u00a0and\u00a0Treasurer of the\u00a0College,\u00a0had prevented\u00a0him from\u00a0speaking\u00a0at the Odd Fellows Hall in Newark. According to Burleigh, Wilson claimed that \u201cthe subject of anti-slavery [was]\u2026destructive to harmony and welfare of the community.\u201d<sup>[13]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0An enslaver himself, Wilson had a vested interest in suppressing anti-slavery sentiment. Here, then, we see representatives from Delaware College\u2019s leadership actively shaping the\u00a0conversation\u00a0relating to slavery in the college\u00a0<em>and\u00a0&lt;\/em&gt;in the community. As prominent citizens, the\u00a0trustees\u2019 actions\u00a0would likely have been known and discussed among students, and would therefore have been part of the unofficial education at Delaware College.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>What does this history mean for the University of Delaware today? While the university proclaims that it \u201cexists to cultivate learning, develop knowledge, and foster the free exchange of ideas,\u201d this examination of the school\u2019s earliest years shows how faculty and trustees actively suppressed one of the most important conversations of the era.<sup>[14]&lt;\/sup&gt; Bringing this history to light is an important step in living up to the school\u2019s mission \u2013 but presenting this information is not an end unto itself. Instead, we must consider how the university\u2019s quiescent stance on slavery relates to larger patterns of inequality and exclusion within the school, even to the present day. Reports in the mid-twentieth and early twenty-first centuries reveal that the university has fostered a hostile environment for many students of color and that as a result, the demographics of the school reflected an under-representation of Black students in relation to the population of Delaware.<sup>[15]&lt;\/sup&gt;\u00a0This history is not static, then, but is tied to ongoing problems of racial inequity within the school. Only through reckoning with the past can the university fully understand its present and plan for a more equitable future.&lt;\/p&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Margaret Hughes is a PhD student in the History of American Civilization program at the University of Delaware.
