Students conducted 25 interviews, with participants drawn from two principal communities: African American alumni of the University of Delaware and residents of the Newark, Delaware&#8217;s New London Road\/Cleveland Avenue neighborhood. The collection can be accessed at <a href=\"https:\/\/library.udel.edu\/special\/\">Special Collections at Morris Library<\/a>. Interviewees were identified through a close collaboration with the Delta Sigma Theta sorority and its representative, Denise Hayman, a University of Delaware alumna and former Newark, Delaware, resident. Their recollections are framed by Delaware&#8217;s troubled experience with de jure and de facto racial discrimination, as interviewees reflect on their experiences living in Newark and\/or attending the University of Delaware in the 1950s-1980s. An online exhibition featuring selected interviews from this collection &#8211; with recordings and transcripts &#8211; is available on the UD Library site: <a href=\"https:\/\/exhibitions.lib.udel.edu\/oral-histories-african-americans-and-ud\/\">\u201cOral History: African Americans and the University of Delaware.&#8221; <\/a><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What was life like for African Americans at UD and in Newark in the 1950s-1980s?&#8230; <a class=\"continue\" href=\"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/2022\/07\/28\/oral-history-interviews-african-americans-the-university-of-delaware-collection\/\">Continue Reading<span> Oral History Interviews: African Americans &#038; the University of Delaware Collection<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":12354,"featured_media":1672,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_coblocks_attr":"","_coblocks_dimensions":"","_coblocks_responsive_height":"","_coblocks_accordion_ie_support":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[13],"tags":[],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1668"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/12354"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1668"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1668\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1673,"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/1668\/revisions\/1673"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1672"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1668"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=1668"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/sites.udel.edu\\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=1668"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
