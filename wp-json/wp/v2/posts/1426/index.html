In 1915, this land was sold to Delaware College, the predecessor to the University of Delaware.<sup>[2]<\/sup> Throughout his life, Lewis and his family profited from the work of Black laborers, using a variety of labor systems to do so, including multiple, overlapping forms of bondage (enslavement, apprenticeship, and indenture), as well as waged labor. Characteristic of Newark-area landowners, the Lewis family\u2019s exploitation strategies are part of the University of Delaware\u2019s historical entanglement with slavery and other systems of unfreedom, and illustrate the complexity of labor relations in Delaware, even in a supposed \u201cage of manumission.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Syl Woolford, a Delaware historian, has studied the Lewis Family, along with their reliance on unfree labor in great depth. He has kindly shared his research related to the Lewis Family to those of the UD and Newark community. Through his dedicated work, he unearthed much of the information related to the enslaved and indentured persons who resided within the Lewis Household. His findings inform the breadth of this work.<\/p>\r\n<p>Both Albert Lewis and his wife Catharine hailed from slave holding families and grew up watching their parents buy, sell and own Black laborers.<sup>[3]<\/sup> After marrying, they bound over a dozen Black individuals from the 1820s to the 1860s.<sup>[4]<\/sup> The variety of methods the Lewis family used to secure labor show the extent of their reliance on bound Black laborers. While the Lewis family census records indicate \u201cFree Blacks\u201d in their household, this definition of freedom is narrow.<sup>[5]<\/sup> Vagrancy laws limited out-of-state travel for free Blacks; vagabond laws made it legal for unemployed or idle Black Delawareans to be indentured; and Black parents the authorities found to be unfit could see their children forced into exploitative apprenticeships. Such regulations allowed White residents to exercise social control over free Black Delawareans.\u00a0 The Lewis\u2019 utilized these laws to secure a cheap supply of labor; and without it, they could not have earned their fortune.<\/p>\r\n<p>The practice of delayed manumission was one of the tactics utilized by White Delawareans to define Black freedom.<sup>[<\/sup><sup>6<\/sup><sup>]<\/sup> Manumission was legal in Delaware, unlike many other slave states, but the date of final, formal freedom was up to individual enslavers \u2013 who often kept control of their human property well into their prime laboring and reproductive years. Albert and Catherine delayed the manumission of their enslaved laborers to twenty-one years of age for males, and twenty-eight years of age for females.<sup>[7]<\/sup> According to Essah, this practice of deferred manumission \u201cresulted in the creation of a large class of Delaware Blacks who were neither free nor slave.\u201d<sup>[8]<\/sup> She refers to these individuals as \u201cquasi-free\u201d and \u201chalf-free.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p>Albert Lewis was also accused of taking a free Black teenager into bondage. In 1825, James Reynolds, a free Black man, claimed that Albert \u201cobtained fraudulent apprenticeship papers against his twelve-year-old son, James.\u201d<sup>[9]<\/sup> Reynolds demanded for the contract to be voided and that his son be set free. The 1830 Census for the Lewis Family does not include the young James. However, it is not certain if he was immediately returned to his family, as the entry for the Reynolds household does not include him in the 1830 census.<sup>[10]<\/sup><\/p>\r\n<p>In 1837, Henry Duffy was sold to Catherine by Jefferson Lewis at the price of $50.<sup>[11]<\/sup> Jefferson, Albert\u2019s brother, acquired Duffy through the Trustees of the Poor in 1825. The Trustees of the Poor were tasked with overseeing the condition of free Black Children, along with those in Delaware who were impoverished, unemployed, or in the case of children, orphaned. In 1811, the Trustees required Black parents to demonstrate that they were able to care for their children. If deemed unfit, the Trustees could place these children into a term of bondage, either in the form of an indenture or an apprenticeship.<sup>[12]<\/sup> In Duffy\u2019s case, it was believed that he did \u201cnot [have] parents of sufficient ability to raise him.\u201d Subsequently, at just four years-old he was apprenticed to Jefferson Lewis until he reached the age of twenty-one.<sup>[13]<\/sup><\/p>\r\n<p>The relationship Albert maintained with Henry\u2019s father, Edward Duffy, suggests that the Lewis\u2019 consciously manipulated these regulations in order to secure Black labor. According to Albert\u2019s financial records, he hired Edward to tend to his farm in Kent County. Edward\u2019s duties included stacking corn, cradling wheat, and butchering hogs. Albert gave the laborer meager payments in exchange for this work, and subsequently the debt in which Edward accrued often outweighed his salary. In one instance, Edward\u2019s purchase of salt, rum, and corn from Albert exceeded the payment he received for \u201ckilling hogs\u201d and \u201ccutting up.\u201d<sup>[14]<\/sup> It is possible that such incidents of accumulating debt encouraged Albert, along with his brother Jefferson (who also oversaw the property), to deem Edward as unable to care for Henry. When Henry was purchased by Catherine, five years remained of his apprenticeship.The apprenticeships of James Reynolds and Henry Duffy demonstrates how Black children who were born free and raised in a free Black household could easily fall into bondage &#8211; to the Lewis\u2019s benefit.<\/p>\r\n<p>Catherine added to the number of Black laborers in the Lewis Family Household in 1834 with the purchase of Eliza Ivory from Mary Green. Eliza was \u201cquasi-free,\u201d manumitted, but for a future date. Catherine bought the 14 years remaining on Eliza\u2019s enslavement term for $100.<sup>[15]<\/sup> The Lewis family utilized Eliza\u2019s reproductive power to secure additional, future unfree labor. Throughout these few years on the Lewis Estate, Henry Duffy and Eliza had four children. Three of these children\u2013Phoebe, Harriet, and Henry\u2013died during infancy. (The frequency of these deaths, along with Eliza\u2019s early death in 1852, suggests that Eliza may have been overworked or malnourished.) Their surviving child, Ann, was born in 1841, and was indentured by the Lewis\u2019s for a term that ran until she was 28 years old.<sup>[16]<\/sup><\/p>\r\n<p>When Henry Duffy\u2019s apprenticeship expired in 1842, Eliza did not birth another child for two years. During this short break, Catherine and Albert devised a means in which they could continue benefiting from Eliza\u2019s reproductive labor. From 1844 to 1850, Eliza birthed three children from three different fathers: David (b. 1844, son of a Robert Harris), Susan (b.1847, daughter of a Benjamin F. Comegys) and Elizabeth (b.1850, daughter of a Tom Smith).<sup>[17]<\/sup> As Ann had been, David, Susan, and Elizabeth were all indentured by the Lewis\u2019s soon after their births. When Catherine laid upon her death bed in 1847, she passed Eliza and her children, Ann, David, and Susan, down to her children, Edmund, Mary, Henrietta, and Hester. Along with determining the inheritance of these bound Black laborers, Catherine also calculated the monetary worth of each of these persons. In a list of her personal property, Catherine valued Eliza, along with three of her children, at the total price of $325.<sup>[18]<\/sup>\u00a0 The Lewis\u2019s not only benefited from Eliza\u2019s productive and reproductive labor to build their wealth, they monetized it, and transferred it to their children.<\/p>\r\n<p>The bondage of Eliza\u2019s children did not deter Albert and Catherine from securing other sources of bound Black labor. In 1844, the couple apprenticed John Thomas Kerr, a five-year-old Black child for a term of sixteen years. During this time, he was \u201cto be taught\u2026in the trade\u2026of farming or husbandry.\u201d<sup>[19]<\/sup> In addition to Kerr, twelve-year-old James Chippa was indentured to Albert for a term of eight years and six months in 1849. In exchange for his labor, Chippa was to receive \u201cone quarter [of] schooling in [the] Winter season.\u201d<sup>[20]<\/sup> Kerr and Chippa both ran away before they completed their terms. <sup>[21]<\/sup><\/p>\r\n<p>The wealth accumulated by the Lewis Family could not have been achieved without the labor exerted by the Black individuals who were bound to Albert and Catherine. As Delaware College received property and a monetary donation from the Lewis\u2019s, the institution directly benefited from this wealth. Financial contributions include a donation of $100 from Albert, which was put toward the college\u2019s endowment fund.<sup>[22]<\/sup> More significantly, however, in 1915 Delaware College acquired the land in which the Lewis Family\u2019s enslaved persons once labored, thus further connecting the school with Catherine and Albert\u2019s reliance on unfree labor.<sup>[23]<\/sup> By accepting a donation from Albert Lewis, and then buying the Lewis Family property, Delaware College benefitted from the wealth generated from systems of unfreedom. The land in which they purchased with this corrupted wealth ultimately determined the shape of University of Delaware\u2019s modern-day campus.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Maureen Iplenski is a PhD student in the History Department and Museum Studies Program<\/em><\/span><\/p>\r\n<hr \/>\r\n<p><sup>[1]<\/sup> Albert Lewis and Thomas Blandy, March 20, 1844, Lewis Family Papers, \u200b1696-1915, MSS 0130, Box 2, Folder 14, Special Collections, University of Delaware Library, Newark, DE;\u00a0 Jacob Price and Samuel M.
