This post will focus on the financials of the College in its earliest years, during the antebellum period. At this time, one of the most important sources of funds for the College was tuition paid by students. Determining whether the wealth of students and their families derived from participation in slavery and other forms of labor exploitation is therefore one avenue for investigating how the College was connected to the institution of slavery. This research zooms in on four students enrolled during the 1837-1838 school year, selected from the earliest available College records: Albert Emory, William Benneson, William W. Ferris, and Thomas Bell. Archival research shows that these students\u2019 families benefited financially from the exploitation of Black people, and this wealth and power accumulated from the labor of Black people transferred to the College through their status as tuition-paying customers.<\/p>\r\n<p>These four accounts do more than illustrate Delaware\u00a0College\u2019s ties to slavery. They\u00a0also reflect the complicated\u00a0systems of bondage in\u00a0Delaware. Unlike some other slave\u00a0states, in Delaware\u00a0private acts of manumission\u00a0were\u00a0legal \u2013 but\u00a0enslaved people were rarely freed\u00a0unconditionally. Many\u00a0were forced to\u00a0serve what amounted to\u00a0\u201cextended\u00a0pre-manumission\u00a0indentures\u201d \u2013 terms of service that\u00a0extended their bondage well into their prime working years \u2013 and when finally free, faced limits on their civil and political rights.<sup>[1]<\/sup> Historian Patience Essay terms this\u00a0condition \u201chalf freedom,\u201d\u00a0and calls\u00a0into question census records that record the\u00a0manumitted\u00a0as\u00a0\u201cfree black people.\u201d<sup>[2]<\/sup> Additionally,\u00a0many \u201cfree\u201d Black people, especially children,\u00a0were\u00a0bound\u00a0\u00a0by\u00a0apprenticeship contracts, which theoretically bound them to labor for their masters in return for food, clothing, and some vocational training \u201ceducation\u201d \u2013 but in practice were far more exploitative.\u00a0To reflect these complexities, this project adopts a wider understanding of how Black labor was exploited during the antebellum era, considering not only chattel slavery \u2014 that is the ownership of Black people as property \u2014 as a form of exploitation of Black labor for the benefits of white people, but also indentured servitude, low, unlivable wages, and apprenticeship contracts as forms of exploitation and unfreedom. Thus, the paper\u2019s terminology will broadly utilize the term \u201cexploitation\u201d to capture these states of unfreedom.\u00a0These four case studies show the complications of realizing freedom in a nation that was polarized on the subject of slavery, in a state that refused to legislate against slavery, and at a college that struggled for financial stability.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Albert Emory<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns coblocks-animate is-layout-flex wp-container-core-columns-is-layout-1 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\" data-coblocks-animation=\"fadeIn\">\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis: 25%;\">\r\n<p>1821-1886, Queen Anne\u2019s County, Maryland<sup>[3]<\/sup><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis: 25%;\">\r\n<p><em>Attended UD<\/em>: 1837<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis: 25%;\">\r\n<p><em>Background:<\/em> Thomas Emory (father) was an enslaver; census records from 1800-1840 show he held over 30 slaves; served in the Maryland State Senate<sup>[4]<\/sup><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\" style=\"flex-basis: 25%;\">\r\n<p><em>After UD: <\/em>Emory served in the pro-slavery Democratic party as a lawyer and advocate for the expansion of slavery, supporting the pro-slavery presidential campaign John C.

After his\u00a0time at Delaware College, it seems that Thomas worked with his father in some capacity at his\u00a0female seminary.

In the case of Thomas Bell, his father was not only a trustee at the College for a period but kept in close contact with those in power at the College after he left this position through his ladies\u2019seminary. This makes the fact that Bell was an enslaver as of the 1840 census even more significant. The College not only benefited from the tuition dollars generated from enslavement that went from the Bells to the College, but also from the broader relationship between the Bell family and the College.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>The Legacies of Tuition and Enslavement<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Together, the disparate histories of these four students at Delaware College in the same year tell a broader story about the relationship between students, their families, Black labor, and the College. These histories illustrate that the diversity of geographical and financial backgrounds brought students with widely differing experiences with the exploitation of Black people into contact, raising questions about how these students may have exchanged ideas with each other. What would happen in a conversation between Albert Emory and William Benneson, for instance? Would Emory have spread the sentiments of an enslaver to other students? Would other students have fought back against this rhetoric or just avoided the subject in order to maintain the peace?\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>The College\u2019s survival was based on wealth generated from the institution of slavery and from other forms of exploitation. College education was and continues to be a business where a consumer pays for a service, though only recently has college education been discussed in these terms. Therefore, the University today must acknowledge that the money that allowed the College to survive in the nineteenth century came from the exploited labor of Black people. The survival of the university today is in debt to the labor of Black people. The question of the ways in which Delaware College benefited and interacted with enslavement and other exploitative labor practices is one worth answering because it addresses the University of Delaware\u2019s history of racial injustice and the legacies that this history has on the present day.\u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><em>Tara Lennon is a senior history and English double-major at UD from Newark, Delaware.
