This research project draws on Katherine McKittrick\u2019s concept of Black geography as the framing of this act of reparative justice. The reconceptualization of the 1849 map is the work McKittrick considers, \u201cthe site of memory is also the sight of memory\u2014imagination requires a return to and engagement with painful places, worlds where Black people were and are denied humanity\u2026through different forms of violence and disavowal.\u201d<sup>[2]<\/sup><\/p>\r\n<p>For the purposes of this project, reparative justice is significant. Reparative justice \u201cmeasures seek to repair, in some way, the harm done to victims as a result of human rights violations committed against them.\u201d<sup>[3]<\/sup> The act of reparative justice in this project is making visible Black existence that was previously erased on the map that only features white landowners. The violation here is the silencing or erasure of Blackness geographically. The Black residents of historic White Clay Creek Hundred deserve \u201cmeasures that seek to repair\u201d the erasure of their existence.\u00a0 This kind of harm was purposeful\u2014it indicated what it meant to be othered \u2014 because it was believed that identity is not owed to the Black body.<\/p>\r\n<p>To recover these names of Black residents, archival sources ranging from 1820-1860 were consulted, including United States census records, the George Evans Family Papers collection housed in the University of Delaware Special Collections, the <a href=\"https:\/\/archives.delaware.gov\/collections-gateway\/apprentice-indentures\/\">Delaware Public Archives Apprentice Indentures database<\/a>, and Syl Woolford\u2019s research on the Lewis family. I specifically chose to generate names from this forty year period to gather as many names as possible for this project. Black existence could only be found in white records. While I was able to access many of these sources, I must recognize that it was not as easy to find Black existence as I had hoped. Black life in the archive consists of silences and erasure. I do not believe that the map is fully accurate to the amount of Black individuals in the households I researched, but what I do have is a start in the right direction.<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"2021 Reconceptualized Map of White Clay Creek Hundred\" src=\"\/\/www.arcgis.com\/apps\/Embed\/index.html?webmap=6c57e19122b54feeb3f6f18a937eef48&amp;extent=-75.779,39.6746,-75.7542,39.6859&amp;home=true&amp;zoom=true&amp;previewImage=false&amp;scale=true&amp;disable_scroll=false&amp;theme=dark\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<h4>Reading the Map<\/h4>\r\n<p>The reconceptualized map of White Clay Creek Hundred was created in ArcGIS. The map features the 1849 map with an overlay of Newark now. Surrounding the names of each white landowner are clusters of green pinpoints. Each pinpoint represents a Black person of some qausi-freedom. The map is interactive and when clicked on, the pinpoint will open a textbox that provides the following information: name, date, sex, status, and source. The dates are not always indicative of birth, but rather indicate when the Black residents show up in the white historical record: counted for a census or listed in an apprenticeship agreement or indenture. When an individual\u2019s name, sex, or status was not indicated in the record, \u201cunknown\u201d was listed as a placeholder. If their name was provided, usually it was just a first name. For most of the enslaved Black people found in white households, unknown was put in place of their actual names because that information was erased from the history of White Clay Creek Hundred.<\/p>\r\n<p>The common occupations listed for the Black residents present in the selected list of white landowners\u2019 households were farming, cabinet making, and husbandry. The map indicates that farming was, by far, the main occupation for Black residents of free, apprenticed, or indentured status.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Present-Day Implications<\/h4>\r\n<p>The reconceptualized map illustrates how closely tied Black life is to the landscape of the University of Delaware. Black people labored upon the land the school rests upon and inhabited many of the areas the university is positioned. New London Road no longer looks the same, as student housing has taken over the space that once was a thriving free Black community. Gentrification has plummeted through the area. As for Delaware, Carole Marks states that Black people \u201chave established themselves as a vital and integral part of the state. Black labor\u2014both slave and free\u2014was essential to its economic development. But its dependence of Black labor itself was problematic.\u201d<sup>[4]<\/sup> They maintain the upkeep of the university, work the university must depend on. The University of Delaware cannot effectively and truthfully tell its history without acknowledging how vital Black life was to White Clay Creek Hundred\u2019s landscape and even though the name has changed to Newark, Black life is still vital to this area today. Just as the university acknowledges its status as a land-grant institution, it must also indicate who labored on the land the university occupies.<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Britney Henry (she\/her) is an English and Museum Studies PhD student at the University of Delaware studying Black popular culture and Black material texts.
